    #* User Queries:
    ## The following queries are being typed here mainly as a resource for you.

    #? Find all chirps for a particular user

    User.find_by(username: 'like_mike').chirps # two queries

    # one query version
    # HINT: involves joins

    # User.joins(:chirps).having("username = 'like_mike'") # having is paired with group
    Chirp.joins(:author).where("username = 'like_mike'").select("chirps.*")
            #association name  

    #? Find all chirps liked by people affiliated with JavaScript

    Chirp.joins(:likers).where("political_affiliation = 'JavaScript'")   

    # unique values version
    Chirp.joins(:likers).where("political_affiliation = 'JavaScript'").distinct   


    #? Find all chirps with no likes

    Chirp.left_outer_joins(:likes).where(likes: { id: nil })

    #? Find the number of likes each chirp has

    Chirp.select(:id, :body, "count(*) AS num_likes").joins(:likes).group(:id)
    Chirp.joins(:likes).group(:id).pluck(:body, "count(*) AS num_likes") # returns num of likes

    #? Find chirps with at least 3 likes (try to use pluck)
    # what if we also wanted the number of likes? (look above)

    Chirp.select(:id, :body, "count(*) AS num_likes").joins(:likes).group(:id).having("count(*) > 2").pluck(:body, "count(*)")
    Chirp.joins(:likes).group(:id).having("count(*) > 2").pluck(:body, "count(*)")


    #? Find all chirps created by someone age 99 that were also liked by someone age 99
                                                                # alias for the joins table was made under the hood
